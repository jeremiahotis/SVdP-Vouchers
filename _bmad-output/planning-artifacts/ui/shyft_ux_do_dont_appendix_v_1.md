# Shyft UX Do / Don’t Appendix

**Version:** v1

**Status:** Companion to the Shyft UX, Design, and Brand System

This appendix exists to make Shyft’s design governance immediately actionable. It translates principles into clear behavioral boundaries.

---

## Do

### Structure & Flow
- Do design around a single clear decision at a time
- Do use progressive disclosure to reduce cognitive load
- Do establish identity before eligibility, and eligibility before action
- Do constrain layouts to readable widths

### Visual Language
- Do use neutral colors for structure and information
- Do reserve accent color for true decisions and primary actions
- Do maintain consistent spacing using the defined scale
- Do favor calm density over information compression

### Copy & Tone
- Do write with confidence and restraint
- Do assume the steward is competent and acting in good faith
- Do explain only what is necessary, where uncertainty arises

### Components
- Do treat read-only information as informational, not interactive
- Do use Decision Cards for consequential choices
- Do auto-fill steward information where possible

---

## Don’t

### Structure & Flow
- Don’t present multiple competing decisions on one screen
- Don’t force users to scan long forms to understand priority
- Don’t require confirmation steps that add no clarity

### Visual Language
- Don’t use color to create urgency
- Don’t use multiple primary buttons
- Don’t introduce decorative elements that compete with content

### Copy & Tone
- Don’t use pity, crisis framing, or emotional pressure
- Don’t preemptively warn users they might make mistakes
- Don’t explain policy unless the user has reached the point of doubt

### Components
- Don’t make non-editable information look editable
- Don’t re-serialize whole files or screens when a patch will do
- Don’t override global tokens or interaction standards

## Litmus Test

Before shipping any UI, ask:

- Can the user name the decision they’re making within 3 seconds?
- Is anything on this screen trying to persuade rather than clarify?
- Does the interface trust the user as much as the policy does?

If the answer to any is no, revisit the Decision Surface.

## Closing Note

This appendix is not about aesthetics.

It is about protecting dignity, trust, and clarity at scale.
