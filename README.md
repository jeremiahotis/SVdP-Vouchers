## Business Rules

### Eligibility Windows

**90-Day Window**: Households can receive one voucher per 90 days
- **Conference Requests (Vincentians)**: Blocked by non-Emergency vouchers only
- **Emergency Requests (Cashiers)**: Blocked by ANY voucher (including Emergency)

**30-Day Expiration**: Vouchers expire 30 days after creation
- Expired vouchers cannot be redeemed
- Status automatically calculated as "Expired"

**Annual Coat Reset**: Winter coat eligibility resets August 1st
- One coat per household per year
- Eligibility calculated from most recent August 1st

### Override Capability

Cashiers can override duplicate rules for true emergencies:
- Cashier name is recorded in override note
- Override date is automatically logged
- Maintains accountability and audit trail

### Status Workflow
Created → Active (0-30 days, unredeemed)
→ Redeemed (marked as used)
→ Expired (30+ days, unredeemed)

## Shortcodes

### Voucher Request Form

**Basic:**
[svdp_voucher_request]
Shows dropdown of all conferences

**Conference-Specific:**
[svdp_voucher_request conference="st-mary-fort-wayne"]
Pre-selects conference, hides dropdown

### Cashier Station
[svdp_cashier_station]
Requires user to be logged in with "SVdP Cashier" role or Administrator
